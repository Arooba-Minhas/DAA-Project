\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

In the realm of computational geometry, convex hull algorithms stand as pivotal solutions to the challenge of identifying the convex hull within a given set of points. This report delves into the exploration of five distinct algorithms, each bringing its own unique approach to resolving the convex hull problem. Concurrently, the report also delves into the intricacies of Line Segment Intersectionâ€”a fundamental problem in computational geometry. This particular challenge involves determining the intersection of two provided line segments. Within this context, the report scrutinizes
three different algorithms, each offering its distinct methodology for tackling the Line Segment Intersection problem.
