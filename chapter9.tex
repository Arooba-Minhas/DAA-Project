\section{\textbf{CONCLUSION:}}
In conclusion, the choice of a convex hull algorithm 
depends on the specific requirements of the 
application. For large datasets, Graham Scan and 
Quick Elimination prove to be efficient, while Jarvis 
March and Andrew's Algorithm strike a balance 
between performance and simplicity. Additionally, 
the choice of a Line Segment Intersection algorithm 
depends on specific requirements and considerations. 
The CCW computation and Vector Cross Product 
methods demonstrate efficient and reliable 
intersection detection. The algebraic method, while 
accurate, may have variable computational costs. The 
provided GUI enhances user interaction and 
visualization of the algorithms.
