\begin{abstract}
This report presents the implementation and analysis of five convex hull algorithms—Brute Force, Jarvis March, Gramham Scan, Quick Elimination, and Andrew’s Algorithm, as well as a Line Segment Intersection algorithm using three different methods—Algebraic, CCW Computation, and Vector Cross Product. The implementation is carried out in Python, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the results of both sets of algorithms. These algorithms are applied to respective sets of points and line segments, and their time and space complexities are thoroughly analyzed. The report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance characteristics and suitability of each algorithm in their respective problem domains.
